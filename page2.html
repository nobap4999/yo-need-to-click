            <p>The feeling of not being able to talk to you in person or do anything I originally thought I would honestly kils me so I thought it would be decent to just try something else that you may appreciate even though its lowk odd and I am sorry I could not have done anything better.</p>
            <p>I don't think that I've felt half as close with anyone as I do with u. It feels almost like whenever I'm w u I just have a great peace of mind. Everything about you is honestly beyond anything I could ask for and I just feel that there is just no chance that I can let today go past without doing anything that shows I truly appreciate you so I just really wanted to do this and tell you that I really just appreciate you and your presence.</p>
            <p>Happy Valentines Day Charlotte you mean so much to me.</p>
